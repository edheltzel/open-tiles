# Open Tiles

This is a repository for open source style tiles for developers who need design help and designers who need inspiration.

Style tiles were developed by Samantha Warren.  To learn more about style tiles, check out her website: [styletil.es](http://www.styletil.es).

## Labeling Style Tiles

Please make sure to include the following labels in your style tile:

- A descriptive name (theme, color scheme, etc.)
- All hex codes for colors
- All names of Typefaces/font weights used
- Where typefaces can be found (Typekit, Google Fonts etc.)
- *Optional*: What type of project the style tile would work well for (mobile website, portfolio, blog, etc.)

## Saving Style Tiles

Please save all style tiles in the following format:

- An individual `.jpg` file for your style tile with a descriptive name
- A folder with any original design files (`.sketch`, `.fig`, `.xd`, etc.) - can be zipped up if needed.
- File sizes should be 100MB or less (otherwise you won't be able to push them to Github)
  - Alternatively - Storing these files in the cloud would work just as well. (Sketch Cloud, Figma, Creative Cloud, etc.)
